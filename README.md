🧠 Journey to Database Mastery
📋 Overview

Welcome to my personal learning journey toward mastering databases — from the fundamentals of SQL to advanced PL/SQL concepts.

As a Low-Code Appian Developer, I’m expanding my technical depth in database design, query optimization, and procedural SQL programming.
This repository documents everything I learn — theory, practice exercises, use cases, and small projects — to build a complete foundation in database management.

🗺️ Learning Roadmap
1️⃣ SQL Fundamentals

Introduction to Databases & RDBMS Concepts

SQL Syntax and Data Types

CREATE, ALTER, DROP — Table Management

SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT

Filtering, Sorting, and Aliases

Aggregate Functions: SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX

GROUP BY, HAVING

Joins: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL

Subqueries and Nested Queries

Constraints & Keys (Primary, Foreign, Unique)

2️⃣ Intermediate SQL

UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT

Views and Indexes

SQL Functions (String, Date, Numeric)

Case Expressions & Conditional Logic

Database Relationships & Normalization

Transactions and ACID Properties

Performance Optimization Basics

3️⃣ Advanced SQL

Window Functions (Ranking, Partitioning)

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Stored Views and Materialized Views

Query Optimization & Execution Plans

Advanced Joins and Recursive Queries

Error Handling and Query Debugging

4️⃣ PL/SQL (Procedural SQL)

PL/SQL Architecture & Environment

Anonymous Blocks & Control Structures (IF, LOOP, CASE)

Cursors (Implicit & Explicit)

Stored Procedures & Functions

Packages and Triggers

Exception Handling

Collections (Associative Arrays, Nested Tables, VARRAYs)

Dynamic SQL (EXECUTE IMMEDIATE)

Performance Tuning in PL/SQL

5️⃣ Real-World Database Scenarios

Sample Mini-Projects:

Employee Management System
